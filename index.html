        <h3>Painting and Drawing</h3>
        <p>“I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we
          live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos.
          The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead.
          Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.”
          ― W. Somerset Maugham, The Painted Veil</p>

        <h3>Java Development</h3>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have
          as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once,
          run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need
          for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
          (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it
          has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.<br>
          I started coding when i was in the first year of my engineering. Coding is quite interesting so that is the only reason
          for me to make it a part of my career.</p>
